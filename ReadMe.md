When I started building my site years ago it was with the express purpose of being a photography portfolio. 

It grew over time, showcasing breadcrumbs that lead to various projects on GitHub, Exposure, or various short-lived cooking blogs. I came to realize that a codified web presence was not for me—the constant planning and strategic updates, the immaculately manicured blog posts, the galleries set with surgical intent. It felt ridged, and prohibitive; sporadic updates became a chore. 

Enter a new concept: “a digital garden”. 

A corner of the web that I can cultivate and design in the open. A place for new ideas, exploratory concepts, and general fun. 

I am really excited about what this means for my portfolio online. Ultimately, I hope that this leads to it feeling more like me, and less like a resume. 

### Built With 
- Gatsby, React framework 
- Netlify, host
- Contentful, CMS
- Cloudinary, share card generation
- Theme UI, primitives 
- MDX, components in markdown
- Segment, analytics & more
- GCN, pagination, tags, base component structure


Things are set up to allow for modular page creation through Contentful using MDX (pages that fit within the design constraints), or through stand-alone custom pages that exist without the standard Layout wrapper. 

This is fun.
