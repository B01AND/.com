### iammatthias.com 

When I started building my site years ago it was with the express purpose of being a photography portfolio. 

It grew over time, showcasing breadcrumbs that lead to various projects on GitHub, Exposure, or various short-lived cooking blogs. I came to realize that a codified web presence was not for me—the constant planning and strategic updates, the immaculately manicured blog posts, the galleries set with surgical intent. It felt ridged, and prohibitive; sporadic updates became a chore. 

Enter a new concept: “a digital garden”. 

A corner of the web that I can cultivate and design in the open. A place for new ideas, exploratory concepts, and general fun. 

I am really excited about what this means for my portfolio online. Ultimately, I hope that this leads to it feeling more like me, and less like a resume. 

#### Built With 
- [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), host
- [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com), CMS
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/), share card generation
- [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/), primitives 
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), components in markdown
- [Segment](https://segment.com/), analytics & more
- [GCN](https://github.com/ryanwiemer/gatsby-starter-gcn), pagination, tags, base component structure. Heavily modified for personal use cases. 


Things are set up to allow for themed modular page creation through Contentful using MDX, or through stand-alone custom pages that exist without the standard Layout wrapper. 

This is fun.
